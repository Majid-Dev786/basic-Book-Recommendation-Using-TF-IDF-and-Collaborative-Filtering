# Basic Book Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project utilizes a Python script to create a basic book recommendation system using techniques from both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. 

By leveraging the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method and collaborative filtering via nearest neighbors, it offers personalized book recommendations to users.

## About The Project

The book recommendation system is designed to recommend books based on user preferences and similar users' tastes. 

It processes data from three CSV files containing information about books, users, and ratings. 

The script cleans, merges, and preprocesses the data, setting up a foundation for making recommendations through TF-IDF vectorization and collaborative filtering techniques.

## Key components of the project:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization for content-based filtering
- Collaborative filtering using Nearest Neighbors
- A method to combine recommendations from both approaches

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.
